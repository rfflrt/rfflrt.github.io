On my first post on this personal page, I briefely mentioned I was interested on EEG decoding using CNNs.
This interest happened to become my first research project, oriented by Dr. Nina S. T. Hirata and funded by FAPESP, started on August 2025.<br>

This post is the first about this research, explaining what I want to explore and discover. I intend to make logs of the experiments and progresses, even though some already happened.
I will make one or two posts about what I have already done.
